A support vector machine (SVM) is machine learning algorithm 
that analyzes data for classification and regression analysis. 
SVM is a supervised learning method that looks at data and sorts
 it into one of two categories. 
An SVM outputs a map of the sorted data with the margins 
between the two as far apart as possible. 
SVMs are used in text categorization, image classification, 
handwriting recognition and in the sciences.
A support vector machine is also known as a support vector network (SVN).
